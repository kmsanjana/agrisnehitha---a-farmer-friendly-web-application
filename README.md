The web application “AGRI-SNEHITHA” created will help farmers predict the crop  that provides 
better yield based on soil type, weather and demand based on a predefined dataset. It also helps farmers rent the tools required during the farming process. Farmers can hire the labours and maintains the labour database which include the charges and payments based on number of days the work is done. This helps in creating employment opportunities for the labourers. It helps farmers sell the crop grown by bidding system where the customers can bid the amount for the crop and purchase the crop.
